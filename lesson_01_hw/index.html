        <p>
            Once upon a time there was a little girl named Margaret, and she wanted to cook, so she went into the kitchen and tried and tried, but she could not understand the cookery books, and she made dreadful messes, and spoiled her frocks, and burned her fingers till she cried and cried.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day she went to her grandmother and her mother and her Pretty Aunt and her Other Aunt, who were all sitting sewing, and asked them to tell her about cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
            ‚ÄúWhat is a roux,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúand what‚Äôs a mousse and what‚Äôs an entr√©e? What are timbales and saut√©s and ingredients, and how do you mix them and how long do you bake them? Won‚Äôt somebody please tell me all about it?‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            And her Pretty Aunt said, ‚ÄúSee the flour all over that new frock!‚Äù and her mother said, ‚ÄúDear child, you are not old enough to cook yet‚Äù; and her grandmother said, ‚ÄúJust wait a year or two, and I‚Äôll teach you myself‚Äù; and her Other Aunt said, ‚ÄúSome day you shall go to the cookery-school and learn everything; you know little girls can‚Äôt cook.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            But Margaret said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to wait till I‚Äôm big; I want to cook now; and I don‚Äôt want to do cookery-school cooking, but little girl cooking, all by myself.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
            So she kept on trying to learn, but she burned her fingers and spoiled her dresses worse than ever, and her messes were so bad they had to be thrown away, every one of them; and she cried and cried. And then one day her grandmother said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shame that child should not learn to cook if she really wants to so much‚Äù; and her mother said, ‚ÄúYes, it is a shame, and she shall learn! Let‚Äôs get her a small table and some tins and aprons, and make her a little cookery-book all her own, out of the old ones we wrote for ourselves long ago‚Äîjust the plain, easy things anybody can make.‚Äù And both her aunts said, ‚ÄúDo! We will help, and perhaps we might put in just a few cookery-school things beside.‚Äù
